Symbolism vs Connectionism
    - 1. Definition: Paradigms (top-down vs bottom-up)
        - Symbolism: Ohne Daten; explizite Regeln implementieren; transparent
        - Connectionism: Mit Daten; black-box
        - paradigm meint WIE wird es gebaut; aber wenn einmal gebaut ist gibt es keine Unterscheidung
    - examples
    - hybrid approaches
    
    -> The human brain consists of neurons; it doesn't need to be implemented. So what is the discussion about (definitions aren't applicable, as it hasn't been built by an architect)?
    - (shift from paradigms to architectures; Marucs argues the brain employs some sort of symbol manipulation implemented in neural networks)
    
    - 2. Definition: Architectures (specifically neural nets)
    	- Implicit definition by properties of the architectures
    		- properties themself are a bit blurry (no real definition to measure these properties)
        - neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures:
            - architecture uses abstraction (can be used to implement higher reasoning)
            - can employ sub architectures (internal representations can be used)
                -> different sub architectures are used for different tasks
            - variables are encoded in a small set of neurons
            - network needs representation of symbols on which to apply rules on
            - fewer connections
        - pure connectionism:
            - one big black box
            - no dividing into smaller sub-models
            - variables are encoded by the entire network (or a big part of it); distributed representation
            - many connections (like fully connected)

    - (shift from paradigms to architectures; Marucs argues the brain employs some sort of symbol manipulation implemented in neural networks; The argument is that the brain's connectionist hardware has evolved to create a higher, emergent level of symbolic processing)

2. Definition (mainly associated architectures):
Symbolism “=” Computer program operating on bits implementing a logic engine
Connectionism “=” Neural networks

-> Still not applicable to the human brain, which obviously consists of neurons forming a neural network
    
    - 3. Definition: Architectures (specifically neural nets)
        - Implicit definition by properties of the architectures
            - properties themself are a bit blurry (no real definition to measure these properties)
	idea for explanation: any arch. has both some level of connectionism and symbolism, but they are not mutually exclusive.
        - neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures:
            - architecture uses abstraction (can be used to implement higher reasoning)
            - can employ sub architectures (internal representations can be used) = modularity
                -> different sub architectures are used for different tasks
            - variables are encoded in a small set of neurons of the total neuron in the network (= localist representation: many variables imply smaller neurons which encode them)
            - network needs representation of symbols on which to apply rules on
            - fewer connections
	- Stores knowledge both implicitly (in the neural net's weights) and explicitly (in a symbolic knowledge base with human-readable facts and rules)
        - pure connectionism:
            - one big black box (monolithic, end-to-end models)
            - no (or barely any) dividing into smaller sub-models
            - variables are encoded by the entire network (or a big part of it); distributed representation
            - many connections (like fully connected)
- pure conn. and heavy symbolic is a spectrum
	- on the neuro-symbolic hybrid end: universal computer with logic engine implemented by a neural network
	- on the pure connectionism end: fully-connected MLP with many hidden neurons and layers

Kolomogorov complexity (apply to feedforward <-> recurrent NN)
Discussion about my big cock


Main Claims
Feedforward networks are more “pure connectionistic”, and are hence not well suited for modelling the human brain..
can be argued by Kolomogorov complexity
